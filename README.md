 A large number of empirical studies on asset pricing found that both jump risk and idiosyncratic volatility have certain explanatory power on asset return premium alone, but few literatures consider the joint effect of the two for asset return premium. Based on the high-frequency data of Chinese stocks, this paper estimates the stock jumping risk, and utilizes Fama-French five-factor model to extract the idiosyncratic volatility, and further investigate their mutual influence by combining them into the asset return premium model. The empirical results show that: (1) Both the idiosyncratic volatility and jump risk should be independently priced; (2) When added the idiosyncratic volatility into jump risk-return model, the jump measurement components have less explanatory power for stock premium, indicating these two risk factors that contains common information for the stock premium; (3) The explanatory effects of idiosyncratic volatility and jump risk on return mainly origins from the non-linear form of their interaction, which provides empirical experience for theoretical analysis of the specific forms of risk.
